title: I see there are packages for Nix or another platform not on the website, do you support them?
tags: nix, nixos, repackaged

No. These packages are maintained by people (usually) unrelated to VencordPlusPlus. We can't provide support for unofficial repackages of VencordPlusPlus unless it's an actual bug in the mod itself (except when such bugs occur due to the repackage).

Please forward your support enquiries to the people who maintain these packages instead of us.
